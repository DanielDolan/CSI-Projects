# CSI-Projects
For our Library Application, users can run a program which acts as a program that would be used in a real life library. 
Users have the ability to view books avaliable in the library, view clients of the library, check the status of books, 
return a book they have checked out, or check out a book they wish to take home. This program is written in C++ and 
incorporates a databse with advanced coding. 

For our Newspaper Delivery System, users can run a program which acts as a program used by a news paper company to manage 
its delivery system. Users of the program have the ability to view the households which newspapers are delivered to, view billing
infromation of households, view the specific newspapers being delivered, and what employee/carrier is delivering the paper.
This project also incorporates a GUI so that users can easily use the application. This program was written in C# and incorporates 
CSV files to manage a large database.
